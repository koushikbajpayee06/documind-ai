# Enterprise IT Support Assistant

Enterprise IT Support Assistant is a full-stack document intelligence application designed to retrieve reliable information from internal IT documentation and gradually evolve into an AI-powered support copilot.

The current system extracts content from uploaded documents, splits it into searchable chunks, generates vector embeddings, stores them in ChromaDB, and performs semantic searches with configurable relevance filtering. Grounded RAG answers and support workflows are planned but have not yet been implemented.

## Project Status

🚧 Currently under active development.

The following features are currently working:

- React frontend connected with FastAPI
- PDF, TXT, and Markdown document uploads
- File type and size validation
- Local document storage with UUID-based filenames
- Text extraction from supported documents
- Recursive document chunking
- OpenAI embedding generation
- Persistent ChromaDB vector storage
- Duplicate-safe document indexing
- Semantic similarity search API
- React semantic-search interface
- Raw vector-distance reporting
- Configurable filtering of low-relevance results
- Empty-result handling for irrelevant queries
- Automated unit tests for retrieval filtering

The next milestone is citation-ready document ingestion. PDF pages will be processed separately so that each chunk preserves its source filename, page number, and chunk index. This metadata will later support grounded RAG answers with precise citations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed:

- Python 3.10 or later
- uv
- Node.js
- npm
- Git

## Clone the Repository

Using HTTPS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koushikbajpayee06/enterprise-it-support-assistant.git
cd enterprise-it-support-assistant
```

Using SSH:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:koushikbajpayee06/enterprise-it-support-assistant.git
cd enterprise-it-support-assistant
```

## Backend Setup

### 1. Navigate to the Backend

```bash
cd backend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Using `uv`:

```bash
uv sync
```

Alternatively, create a standard Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it on Windows:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Backend Environment Variables

Create `backend/.env` using `backend/.env.example` as a reference:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=
AWS_REGION=ap-south-1

FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

UPLOAD_DIR=uploads
MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB=10

CHROMA_PERSIST_DIR=vector_db
CHROMA_COLLECTION_NAME=documind_documents
MAX_SEARCH_DISTANCE=1.25
```

Never commit the `.env` file or expose real credentials publicly.

AWS configuration is optional during local development and will be required when S3 integration is implemented. PostgreSQL configuration will be added with the persistent-state milestone.

### 4. Start the FastAPI Server

From the `backend` directory:

```bash
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Backend links:

- API: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Health check: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health
- Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

A successful health check returns HTTP `200` with a `healthy` status and an API availability message.

## Frontend Setup

### 1. Navigate to the Frontend

Open another terminal from the project root:

```bash
cd frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Frontend Environment Variables

Create `frontend/.env` using `frontend/.env.example` as a reference:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### 4. Start the React Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

When both servers are running, the frontend displays the backend health status above the upload and search interfaces.

## Document Upload

Users can upload documents from the React interface.

Supported formats:

- PDF
- TXT
- Markdown

Maximum file size:

```text
10 MB
```

### Upload Endpoint

```http
POST /api/documents/upload
```

The request must use `multipart/form-data` with a field named `file`.

Example successful response:

```json
{
  "message": "Document uploaded, processed, and indexed successfully",
  "original_filename": "example.pdf",
  "stored_filename": "generated-uuid.pdf",
  "content_type": "application/pdf",
  "size_bytes": 587379,
  "character_count": 110399,
  "chunk_count": 138
}
```

During document upload, the backend:

1. Validates the file type and size.
2. Assigns a UUID-based stored filename.
3. Saves the document inside `backend/uploads/`.
4. Extracts readable text from the document.
5. Divides the text into overlapping chunks.
6. Generates embeddings for each chunk.
7. Stores the chunks and embeddings in ChromaDB.

## Semantic Search

The semantic search endpoint retrieves document chunks that are conceptually related to the provided query.

### Search Endpoint

```http
POST /api/search/semantic
```

Example request:

```json
{
  "query": "What are the benefits of APIs?",
  "number_of_results": 3
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "query": "What are the benefits of APIs?",
  "results": [
    {
      "content": "APIs enable different systems and applications to communicate...",
      "metadata": {
        "source": "Complete Notes.pdf",
        "chunk_index": 1,
        "document_id": "generated-deterministic-id"
      },
      "distance": 0.82
    }
  ]
}
```

The search endpoint returns chunks whose raw vector distance is less than or equal to the configured `MAX_SEARCH_DISTANCE`. A smaller distance indicates a closer semantic match. If no result passes the threshold, the endpoint returns an empty `results` list.

Answer generation using the retrieved context will be added in the RAG milestone.

## Duplicate-Safe Indexing

Enterprise IT Support Assistant generates deterministic identifiers for document chunks using their source, chunk index, and content.

This prevents the same chunk from being stored repeatedly when an identical document is uploaded more than once.

## Current Development Status

The application currently supports local document upload, document parsing and chunking, OpenAI embedding generation, persistent ChromaDB indexing, and semantic search through both FastAPI and React.

Search results include source, chunk, and raw vector-distance information. A configurable distance threshold removes low-relevance results, and automated unit tests verify the filtering behavior.

Page-level citations, generated RAG answers, LangGraph workflows, PostgreSQL persistence, authentication, ticket operations, human approval, streaming, and production deployment have not yet been implemented.

## Security

- Secrets are stored using environment variables.
- Sensitive values are handled using Pydantic `SecretStr`.
- Backend and frontend `.env` files are excluded from Git.
- Uploaded documents and local vector data are excluded from version control.
- Uploaded files are validated by extension and size.
- UUID-based stored filenames help prevent filename collisions.
- Production AWS credentials should use restricted IAM permissions.
- Raw documents and sensitive information should not be written to application logs.
- OpenAI and AWS credentials must never be committed to Git.
